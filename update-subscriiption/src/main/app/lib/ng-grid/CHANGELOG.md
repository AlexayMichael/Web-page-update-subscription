## 2.0.6 *(2013-06-?)*

### Features

- **Development**
  - Continuous integration testing with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/angular-ui/ng-grid). A few tests that were looking for pixel perfection had to be relaxed due to rendering differences between browsers and OSes.
  - Moved this changelog to CHANGELOG.md!
  - Added tests for i18n languages. Any new language must cover all the properties that the default language (English) has.
  - CSS files compiling with less ([24bb173](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/24bb173))
  - Added optional --browsers flag for test tasks. `grunt test --browsers=Chrome,Firefox,PhantomJS` will test in all 3 browsers at once.

- **Sorting**
  - Allow optional '+' prefix to trigger numerical sort ([f3aff74](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/f3aff74), [8e5c0a1](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/8e5c0a1))
  - Standardizing sort arrow direction (thanks @dcolens) ([9608488](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/9608488))

- **i18n**
  - Added Brazilian Portugeuse (thanks @dipold) ([ab0f207](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/ab0f207))

### Bug fixes

- Allow column `displayName` to be an empty string. ([#363](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/issues/363), [46a992f](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/46a992f))
- Fix for `totalServerItems` not updating ([#332](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/issues/332), [#369](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/issues/369), [fcfe316](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/fcfe316))
- Fixed regression in [2.0.5](#2.0.5) that used Array.forEach, which isn't supported in IE8. Moved to angular.forEach ([e4b08a7](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/e4b08a7))
- Fixed and added tests for wysiwyg-export plugin ([57df36f](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/57df36f))
- Fixed extraneous trailing comma ([#449](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/issues/449), [2c655c7](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/2c655c7))
- **Cell editing** - various attempts at fixing broken cell editing eventually resulted in using [NgModelController](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngModel.NgModelController) (thanks @swalters). ([#442](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/issues/442), [050a1ba](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/050a1ba), [5c82f9b](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/5c82f9b), [5c82f9b](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/5c82f9b), [f244363](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/f244363), [ee2a5f1](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/commit/ee2a5f1))
